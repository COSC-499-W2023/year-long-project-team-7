<br>
Note: I feel I am falling behind. The account page is turning out to involve more than I anticipated which is why it hasn't been merged yet. This week I'd like to address the issues with it that my team brought to my attention so I can deliver a branch that is up to merging standards. If possible, I will count the additional work to the account page as its own issue so I don't drag the progress of the team down. After this week, I plan on addressing the peer review feedback we got.

Note: I forgot to do my log for week 20. I was working on implementing the forgot password system. I never got the chance to finish it that week but I made up for it during the reading break and finished that feature along with another peer review fixes issue. This week I prepared for our next upcoming peer review by addressing issues that came up with a file deletion system I added. I also reformmated our emails to look more professional.
