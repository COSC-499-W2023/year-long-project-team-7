### Goals

-   Get an image of team dynamics and setup tools for long term
-   Try out a small exercise to get to know our workflow
-   Create an automated testing suite with GitHub Actions
-   Get a feel for logging and documenting work and experiences

### Self Reflection and Learning

Despite the brevity of this exercise, I thought it created a good opportunity for the whole team to get acquainted and to learn to use our project board. Some members of the team were new to GitHub Projects and Actions, so that was a good experience to talk through as a team. We also created a Discord server to discuss the project, and I was very satisfied with the level of engagement we have on it.

As I had worked with these tools before, I helped set up out board and teach some members the workflow with tracking Issues and relating them to pull requests, as well as setting up tests with Actions. The team became adjusted to this workflow very fast, and it seems everyone is comfortable working in this way. I thought my work was easy to accomplish but had a positive impact with the team. Liam and I worked on creating tests for the code, which was a gratifying experience, and I felt like we had good communication throughout.

### Goals

-   Create a project plan to guide us with the project and help partition the work
-   Decide on a Tech Stack we feel comfortable with
-   Get an idea for how we will subdivide the work going forward
-   Determine a MVP to keep scope and expectations under control

### Self Reflection and Learning

This week's meeting was particularly important in determining how to move forward with the project. In particular, we needed to narrow down the idea we have for it into a minimum viable product (MVP) and roughly break this down into sections we expect to work on.

One of the challenges this week was trying to predict our workload for the coming year. We are all very aware that these kinds of plans are often subject to change, but we wanted to have a timeline that was as realistic as possible to our actual needs. This was challenging, but we hope that our plan is robust enough to guide us as the project becomes more complicated.

### Goals

-   Set up the project working environment for everyone
-   Troubleshoot Operating System issues
-   Make a basic landing page and navigation functionality

### Self Reflection and Learning

This week was slower than others because of the ramping up of work in other classes, as well as the unexpected issues we faced when setting up the project in all of our machines. This required an additional meeting and troubleshooting to be able to get everyone up to speed.

Despite this challenge, we were able to work through the issues we had and have a basic landing page set up. We are confident about the work moving forward.

### Tasks

![tasks-screenshot](../../img/esteban-tasks-6.png)

### Goals

-   Create front end for landing page
    -   Content
    -   Animations + Style
-   Create workflow for automatic formatting
    -   GitHub Actions
-   Troubleshoot Javascript issues w/ Ferdinand
-   Troubleshoot CSS issues

### Self Reflection and Learning

In this week I saw good progress with my personal task and felt like I learned to work with CSS in a better way this week. Creating the landing page was simple, but I wanted to have a sophisticated look that reflected modern design language. For this reason, I got more involved with bootstrap CSS and had a fair bit of fun learning to create more interesting design.

Additionally, in this two week period I wanted to create something that would help out the CI process for the whole team. I had previously used an autoformatting tool set up with GitHub actions, so I decided to do the same for this project. I investigated some options and landed on Black for Python and DjLint for HTML with Django. I set up a YAML file to automatically format the code as we push it to the repo. I feel like this change will make our codebase more readable and standarized, and generally keep things tidy in the future.

### Tasks

### Goals

-   Create front end for about page
    -   Content
    -   Style
-   Improve Styling of Navbar
    -   Make it sticky
    -   Better styling for accessibility
-   Style transformer page

### Self Reflection and Learning

This week I mainly focused on getting the front end of our project to a good level prior to our presentation. We wanted a better looking navbar, as well as to prepare the look for the about page and the transformer page.

Unfortunately, at the time of writing I am not done styling the transformer page, but will do so still as part of this milestone ahead of our presentation. This is the first time I feel like I was not able to fully realise all the work I assigned myself this week, so I am re-evaluating my workflow finish tasks earlier in the week and leave time for troubleshooting which usually happens unexpectedly. I think this is a good lesson in preempting problems and taking that into account when thinking about tasks.

I had a chance to use GIMP to modify a free icon for our purposes. This was a nice creative change from the usual work that I enjoyed. I also contributed in keeping with best practices by pruning some deprecated dependencies from the project.
