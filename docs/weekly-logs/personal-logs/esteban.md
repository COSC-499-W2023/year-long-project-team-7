### Goals

- Get an image of team dynamics and setup tools for long term
- Try out a small exercise to get to know our workflow
- Create an automated testing suite with GitHub Actions
- Get a feel for logging and documenting work and experiences

### Self Reflection and Learning

Despite the brevity of this exercise, I thought it created a good opportunity for the whole team to get acquainted and to learn to use our project board. Some members of the team were new to GitHub Projects and Actions, so that was a good experience to talk through as a team. We also created a Discord server to discuss the project, and I was very satisfied with the level of engagement we have on it.

As I had worked with these tools before, I helped set up out board and teach some members the workflow with tracking Issues and relating them to pull requests, as well as setting up tests with Actions. The team became adjusted to this workflow very fast, and it seems everyone is comfortable working in this way. I thought my work was easy to accomplish but had a positive impact with the team. Liam and I worked on creating tests for the code, which was a gratifying experience, and I felt like we had good communication throughout.

### Goals

- Create a project plan to guide us with the project and help partition the work
- Decide on a Tech Stack we feel comfortable with
- Get an idea for how we will subdivide the work going forward
- Determine a MVP to keep scope and expectations under control

### Self Reflection and Learning

This week's meeting was particularly important in determining how to move forward with the project. In particular, we needed to narrow down the idea we have for it into a minimum viable product (MVP) and roughly break this down into sections we expect to work on.

One of the challenges this week was trying to predict our workload for the coming year. We are all very aware that these kinds of plans are often subject to change, but we wanted to have a timeline that was as realistic as possible to our actual needs. This was challenging, but we hope that our plan is robust enough to guide us as the project becomes more complicated.

### Goals

- Set up the project working environment for everyone
- Troubleshoot Operating System issues
- Make a basic landing page and navigation functionality

### Self Reflection and Learning

This week was slower than others because of the ramping up of work in other classes, as well as the unexpected issues we faced when setting up the project in all of our machines. This required an additional meeting and troubleshooting to be able to get everyone up to speed.

Despite this challenge, we were able to work through the issues we had and have a basic landing page set up. We are confident about the work moving forward.
