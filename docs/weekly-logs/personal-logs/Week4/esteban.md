### Goals

-   Create a project plan to guide us with the project and help partition the work
-   Decide on a Tech Stack we feel comfortable with
-   Get an idea for how we will subdivide the work going forward
-   Determine a MVP to keep scope and expectations under control

### Self Reflection and Learning

This week's meeting was particularly important in determining how to move forward with the project. In particular, we needed to narrow down the idea we have for it into a minimum viable product (MVP) and roughly break this down into sections we expect to work on.

One of the challenges this week was trying to predict our workload for the coming year. We are all very aware that these kinds of plans are often subject to change, but we wanted to have a timeline that was as realistic as possible to our actual needs. This was challenging, but we hope that our plan is robust enough to guide us as the project becomes more complicated.
